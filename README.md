### How to make, build, solve X with Y?

I have been programming (professionally) for around a year now. I think I can say I am a little more experienced than a neophyte developer. 

One of the problems I see myself and most like me struggling with is, how to solve a particular problem without reinventing the wheel. While reinventing the wheel should not be a problem for a beginner because that is how we will learn the crux or important parts of it, but the method that we use before sticks with us for long. 

Instead if I could just know about the things that are out there with which we can do it easily (after taking the hard route once or twice), I think that would be great.

You would argue that you can easily do a google search. Yes we can, but a lot of times its difficult to search something because we don't really know what we want and if a tool or a library for it already exists.

### What could the issues be?
#### 1. General software development
  I was working on a big (for me) Java project for the first time, on my own. I didn't know how to check if my code is proper without linking it to the main. Little did I know about unit tests back then. 

#### 2. Web and mobile apps
  Tools to create good boilerplate code for certain web frameworks, libraries that help with login, form validation, etc. Libraries for UI scroll features, nav bars, dialog boxes, etc.

#### 3. Cool things that you can do with certain libraries very easily

#### 4. Code snippets

#### 5. Issues that you think cannot be typed in the search bar because its very verbose to explain

This repository will be collection of such and other recurring issues that can be easily solved with libraries and frameworks already out there (solution need not necessarily be a library or a framework).

Let's build a database of problems that we face generally, frustrate ourselves with :P and later find a better way to do it.

### What you have to do or rather how to contribute?
1. Fork this repo.
2. Either clone and make changes on your machine or do it from the web app. 
3. Modify the [XbyY.md](./XbyY.md) file.
4. Make a PR for changes to be added here.
5. **Star this repository** if you think it's something you find of use. Thanks!

### Template for X and Y
You will directly edit the XbyY.md file with you problem and solution to it. The problem statement will cover your problem. Next, mention the problem category like web apps, mobile apps, ML, etc. Give a brief solution with name of the library or link to it. If its a big library or framework please link specific part of it. You can also give links in tutorials part.

If your solution is not hosted as a tutorial anywhere on the internet, that is, if its a custom one like code snippet or something you can create a code file and tutorial file for it in the folder for code snippets and include the folder in the commit. After that give a link to that specific folder or file in tutorial.
