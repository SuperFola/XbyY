## Solution
### Using unit tests 
You can use unit tests for this. You can write these unit tests once and keep. These unit tests run seperately on your program so you don't actually have to have a flow that connects your program from the main application. Since they run seperately from the main application, you can eliminate console logs. This is also autonomous, in the way that you don't have to do manual checks everytime you change the code.
